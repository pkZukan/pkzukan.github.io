# Scarlet & Violet Guides

### Notes:
- Migrating models from PLA works fairly well with minor changes. The main difference being the file hierarchy (The engine hardcodes paths so this hierarchy must be followed). Some parameters for [trmtr](../formats/trmtr) have changed as well. PLA pokemon uses a int param "CategoryLabel" of 2 whereas SV uses 6 for lighting. UV wrap enums may have changed as well.
